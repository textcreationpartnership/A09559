            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>uching matters of State, which were to me ſtrange and vnknowne: by reaſon that there were amongſt them ſome perſonages exceedingly well learned, and moſt conuerſant and expert in all Hiſtories, and notably well ſeene and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the affaires of the World. There was one aboue the reſt in their company, a man of great ſpirit iudgement, and experience who had ſeene a great part of Europe, and (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene for a long time in Portugall) had dealt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed with the Portugals, whoſe Language he ſpake natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and had read all the Hiſtories of that Realme, and was ſo well acquainted with all their affaires, and knew them all
<pb facs="tcp:18931:3"/> ſo particularly, that I did greatly wonder at it. For, in things that were to come, I found him in manner of a Prophet: in ſo much that for the viuacity and quickneſſe of his ſpirit, and the long experience which hee hath had, he ſeemeth to me to haue as great knowledge in things to come, as if he ſaw them preſent before his eyes. He made proofe vnto me by many reaſons (which did not onely plainely conuince my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but did as it were bind me hand and foote) that theſe voyages, and others of like kinde, would neuer draw with them any other profit, nor ſerue to any other purpoſe, then to waken the ſleeping dogge, and to re-enforce the common enemie. Now conſidering that <hi>Don Philip</hi> King of Caſtile hath a Councell, the moſt choiſe and excellent, ſuch as neuer Prince in this World had a better, his ſeruitors moſt loyall and faithfull, great forces, and abundance of treaſure, vpon the which all other things doe depend: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, hee doth not leaue daily to cauſe diuers Bookes to be imprinted in his fauour and defence, I doe therefore deſire to haue drawne from this learned and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon ſome thing written with his owne hand, which I might preſent vnto your Maieſties: and to this end did I diuers times make requeſt vnto him, but I could neuer get him to yeeld or condeſcend thereunto. Wherefore bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my ſelfe, that as pouerty, griefe, and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, doth bury, and (as it were) kill the ſpirits of a man, ſo the commodities of this life, contentment and cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doth reuiue and quicken them, I determined becauſe I ſaw him ſad, penſiue, and melancholicke, by reaſon of his exile and misfortunes out of his owne Countrey, to procure his pleaſure and contentment, knowing that by this meanes
<pb facs="tcp:18931:3"/> I might obtaine the accompliſhment of my deſire, I did therefore ſet open my gates and my Houſe vnto him, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with my Purſe, and made him partner of my Coyne; I cheriſhed and entertained him for many dayes, and (for loue of him) ſome other of his company. And by this curteſie I made him ſo beholding to me, that afterwards hauing many times held diſpute and conference together, I cauſed him in the end to take his Pen in hand. Thereupon did he compoſe in the Caſtillian Tongue, this Diſcourſe, which he entitled <hi>Trattado paranaetico:</hi> and he preſented it vnto me. The which when I had read, a moſt ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration or aſtoniſhment did rauiſh me: for that I neuer ſaw (I will not ſay in ſo little a Volume) but not euen in great Bookes, ſo many curioſities reported, ſo many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Hiſtories, things ſo ſecret and particular, admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo neceſſary to be embraced, nor counſels ſo iuſt to be followed. And knowing perfectly the excellency of this worke, and how greatly important it would be to be ſeene of your Maieſties, and by the Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Common-weales of Europe. And albeit I know my ſtile to be rude and barbarous, yet ſuch was my ambition (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe mine owne infirmity) that I was not willing that any other ſhould haue the pleaſure in doing it. In ſome places I haue augmented it: holding it ſo to be needfull, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more cleere vnderſtanding of the Hiſtory. Touching the originall, I thought it reaſon not to abridge or cut off any part thereof. I moſt humbly beſeech, in regard of your moſt Chriſtian Maieſties, to receiue it with that good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which Princes oweth to their Subiects: who for his ſeruice, will not eſteeme to hazard the loſſe of all that hee poſſeſſeth: much leſſe to make himſelfe vncapable for the
<pb facs="tcp:18931:4"/> obtaining of that which of right is due vnto him, and who for the good and honour of his Countrey, will ſpend his life moſt freely and willingly. God preſerue and bleſſe the moſt Chriſtian perſons of your Maieſties, with ſo great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſpirituall graces, and aſsiſt you and make you to proſper with ſo many riches of temporall bleſsings, as is poſsible to his diuine Maieſtie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, thou haſt in this little Pamphlet an incomparable treaſure, a rich ſtore-houſe and magazin full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpeeches, true Hiſtories, rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, liuely reaſons, and wholſome counſels: the which if their Maieſties, and the Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Common-weales of Chriſtendome would embrace, follow, and put in execution, without doubt they ſhould ſoone obtaine and find a medicine for ſo many miſchiefes, a remedy for ſo great and continuall afflictions and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable trauels, wherewith their Subiects haue for ſo many yeeres wraſtled and contended. And I dare aſſure them, that by obſeruing the aduiſe here giuen them, they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their Eſtates in time to come from all danger: for euen as the great fiſhes doe perſecute and deuoure the ſmall and little ones; ſo in like manner thoſe neighbours which are moſt mighty and puiſſant, doe deſpoile and conſume the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who are of leſſe puiſſance. Now we know that there are two eſpeciall reaſons for which the Authour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed and drawne out at length this his Diſcourſe, enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with Hiſtories ſo ſingular, and beautifying it with ſuch rare authorities and examples. The former is: for that, as he hath endeuoured liuely to depaint vnto vs our enemy, and to make vs know the naturall diſpoſion of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of whom we haue great cauſe to take good heed; ſeeing that all that which he hath ſpoken, doth ſet forward this his intent and purpoſe, he ſaw it would not be any inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to vſe therein ſome prolixity. If a man by compact, as
<pb facs="tcp:18931:5"/> bound thereto by another, or of his owne proper motion and free will, and vpon curioſity, would vndertake a voyage of ſome three or foure leagues, not hauing any time prefixed nor limited for diſpatch thereof, what harme would it be vnto him, if in his paſſage he doe find ſome Gardens where he may recreate and refreſh himſelfe, from the trauell and weariſomeneſſe of the way? So doe you my Maſters reade this Treatiſe at your pleaſure, vſe it for your recreation, and take your delight in the ſweete odours of her flowres and pleaſant poſies. You neede make no great haſt, there is no man that doth vrge you thereto. A ſecond reaſon of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity of this Treatiſe, is, for that as the Author is driuen of neceſſity to handle the vertues and the vices of diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and ſundry Nations: ſo his will was, that each of them ſhould haue his due deſert: the good and thoſe that haue done well, praiſe and honour; but the euill and vitious, blame and reprehenſion. In the end of this Treatiſe you ſhall find the explication which he promiſeth, Fol. 143; in the which there are many things both of great curioſity, and alſo as neceſſary to the matter in hand as any of the reſt. For that in knowledge, vnderſtanding, and experience, hee doth farre exceed me, as his worke doth ſhew apparantly. Touching the which briefly, I dare not affirme any thing, but this, that each word of his is a ſentence, and that each ſentence containeth many. I muſt confeſſe, that to ſome perſons in particular, his Treatiſe will be ill accepted: but what remedy? he hath ſpoken but the truth, and what he affirmeth he proueth, and hee alledgeth nothing without his Authour to iuſtifie it. And truly I for my part am of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: that it is not againſt reaſon, to publiſh the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vices of ſome one particular perſon, which being true, may be made knowne to euery man, eſpecially when the knowledge thereof may redound to the great good and benefit of the weale publike. But to come to an end, let me entreat you to take in good part that which I haue ſaid.</p>

And there it was firſt by him ordained, concluded and baptized, in imitation of that which was ſo named, and made by the rebels in Caſtile againſt King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, and which afterwards was againe reuiued in fauour of <hi>Iſabell</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> his great grand parents. This great deſigne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of his was faithfully reported vnto the ſaid King (as hath beene ſaid) by this ſtranger his ſeruant with many particularities: and amongſt others, that the Caſtilian had ſent into France nine ſundry men, of purpoſe to corrupt with mony and faire promiſes, the Princes, Lords and Gentlemen of France, of whom many were particularly named, who from thence forward held the party of <hi>Philip,</hi> and many which were ready to doe the like, as the euent did afterwards make manifeſt.

This Captaine <hi>Anthony</hi> diſcouered the whole matter vnto a certaine perſonage in whom he had great truſt and affiance, and requeſted him to keepe it very ſecret, till ſuch time as he ſhould be gotten into France, to aduertiſe the moſt Chriſtian king thereof, and the king of Portugall: vnto whom the ſaid Captaine <hi>Anthony</hi> had prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to communicate it, as he did. And as touching the Captaine <hi>Landreau,</hi> he was enforced to take part with the Caſtilian, and to accept the mony that was offred him for the ſafetie of his owne life: whereof alſo he aduertiſed the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18931:9"/> king of Portugall, who was then at Beauvais on the Sea: and hauing giuen him to vnderſtand to what intent he had done it; he prayed him to looke to the ſafeguard of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for that he was in exceeding great danger. The which the ſaid Prince <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> did within few dayes after proue to be moſt true, and had beene taken, if he had not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe with great ſpeed, as there was then taken one of his ſonnes, with many gentlemen Portugals of his traine, by the people of the Duke <hi>de Mercaeur:</hi> who did ranſacke and make ſpoile of all that did appertaine both to him and his traine, of whom ſome held themſelues happy, that they could get away in ſafetie. Of theſe nine men (of whom I haue ſpoken) certaine were apprehended, who diſcouered the whole intention of the enemy.

               <p>Thirdly, in Spaine there are many nations which do hate the Caſtilian extremely: for that they haue beene tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, either by himſelfe, or by his predeceſſors: and theſe (when they ſhall ſee themſelues aided and aſſiſted in good earneſt, and to purpoſe) for the great deſire which they haue to be at libertie, will ſoone take armes againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>

I doe aſſure you, that two moneths will ſuffice to them of the country to make them ſouldiers.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18931:14"/> The greateſt difficultie is to make them abide, and not to feare the fire of the Hargubuſh.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18931:15"/> the Nauarrois, the Arragonois, or Portugals with theirs, they would haue retired themſelues the one to the other; by whoſe liberalitie they were euer prouided of all things needfull and neceſſary for the life of man, and ſometimes with greater eaſe and commodity then in their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: as it happened in the time of <hi>Fernand</hi> king of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and of <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſecond king of Caſtile, who ſlue his owne naturall and lawfull brother; which was the cauſe that <hi>County Don Fernand de Caſire,</hi> and <hi>Don Alvar peres de Caſtre</hi> his brother: <hi>Men Suares,</hi> Grandmaſter of <hi>Alcantara: Suer Iuan de Parada</hi> Gouernour of the Realme of Galatia: <hi>Petro Giron,</hi> Grandfather of <hi>Calatraua, Alonſo Giron</hi> his Nephew, and many other great Lords and Gentlemen, with a great number of Cities and Townes holding the party of the king deceaſed, did conuey themſelues into Portugall, where they were receiued by the king <hi>Fernand,</hi> and had moſt honourable entertainment, with moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fauours, rich preſents, and incredible gifts, which hee gaue vnto them moſt bountifully.

               <p>Moreouer, the ſaid <hi>Coneſtagio,</hi> as a man of a maligne and peruerſe ſpirit, is a moſt vngratefull enemy of that nation, which hath both aduanced and honoured him. For wee knew him at Lisbon when he ſerued <hi>Anthonio Caulo,</hi> and afterwards with <hi>Stephen Lercaro,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. fol. 62.</note> a Marchant of Genoa. He hath in his booke theſe words:
<q>In Caſtile this ſucceſſion gaue great matter whereof both to muſe and to talke, both in priuate and in publike: for that the king cauſed the Eſtate of Portugall to be vnited to his other Realmes and Dominions, not caring how, nor in what faſhion it were done, ſo it were effected. The which the Nobilitie tooke very ill: in ſo much as it ſeeemeth that all the great men of Spaine, ſince the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth to this day, could not away nor like of the greatneſſe of the king: becauſe thereof it hath proceeded; that hee maketh leſſe reckoning of them then did the ancient kings of Caſtile, and hee conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them to be equall to their inferiours, as well in iuſtice as otherwiſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>Don Antonio</hi> king of Portugall were liuing, hee could witneſſe, how after that the enemie was entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Portugall with a huge armie, and had taken <hi>Lisbon,</hi> hee being then in the towne of Badaios, many Lords of Caſtile did offer him to haue entrance into the ſayd towne, and did promiſe him all their beſt aide and aſſiſtance to ſeize vpon the enemie himſelfe. The which the ſaid Prince could not effect nor put in execution; for that within few dayes after he was diſpoſſeſſed of all the realme in the citie of <hi>Puerto</hi> of Portugall. He could alſo certifie vs, how that ſeeing in theſe parts many great Lords of Caſtile did ſend vnto him, offring him their ſeruice and aſſiſtance, in caſe that he would ſet foot in Portugall: the which matter he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated (if I bee not deceiued) to the king and principall Lords of France, and principally to the eſtate and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18931:16"/> of England. Notwithſtanding, touching this deſire of libertie, it is a matter which doth principally touch the Princes, great Lords, and <hi>Hijos de Algo</hi> of Spaine. For, as concerning thoſe maſters of the long robe, and the raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſort of Caſtilians; they take a pleaſure in this their ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery and ſeruitude vnder the king, becauſe they alone doe command and rule all, and triumphing ouer others, haue the principall and chiefe managing of all the affaires of the Realme: yea, and euen the gouernment of the king himſelfe, in their owne hands. And although they doe hate him moſt extremely, and doe wiſh ill enough to his perſon: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they doe wiſh ſo well to their owne country, and doe ſo delight to ſee themſelues to haue the command ouer all others; that if they know any thing, either in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or in priuat, which might hinder and endamage his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, they will not faile, onely in regard thereof, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe him of it: ſuch is the naturall diſpoſition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians,<note place="margin">Ioſephus de bello Iudaice lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> who being iſſued and ſprung from the race of the Iewes, cannot but follow the tracke of their predeceſſors.

And therefore moſt humbly I beſeech your Maieſties, and all Chriſtian Princes, to keepe your ſelues from the Caſtilians, and not to truſt them,<note place="margin">Good and ſound counſell</note> howſoeuer they ſhew themſelues mortal and deadly enemies to their kings, and do make neuer ſo faire ſemblance, that they are well and heartily affected to do you ſeruice.</p>
               <p>The common ſort of Caſtilians (Sir) are ſo maligne and peruerſe, ſo full of pride, arrogancy, ambition,<note place="margin">The malitious nature of the Caſtilian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and infidelity; that <hi>Fernand</hi> king of Portugall, being the right and lawfull heire to the Realmes of Caſtile and Leon, and being called vpon by the people of the ſame kingdomes, who offred to receiue him for their Lord and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18931:17"/> king, the Portugals would in no wiſe conſent therunto, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that they would not haue any thing to doe, nor med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with them, no not though it were to command ouer them. It was my hap one day, to deuiſe vpon this matter with a noble man of the French kings Councell, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming much aſtoniſhed at the report thereof, did make mee this anſwer: Certainly, this that you tell me, doth make me not ſo much to maruell, as that which I haue heard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of a Fryer Preacher, who in the yeare of our Lord 1576.<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> preaching vpon this part of the Goſpel: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe:</hi> ſaid, that by this precept, God commanded vs, not onely to loue our father and mother, brothers, kinsfolke, friends, and countreymen: but euen heretikes alſo and ſtrangers, Iewes, Paynims,<note place="margin">An example worthy the marking.</note> Moores, Turkes, and the Caſtilians themſelues. This happened (as it was told him) and this Preacher was a religious perſon of the order of S. <hi>Dominicke,</hi> and he did Preach in a pariſh Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch of Lisbon, called Saint <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> being one of the principall Churches within the citie, and there were preſent at it, the moſt part of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the towne, with many Preſidents of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Councellors, Gentlemen, and rich Marchants. The ſaid noble man ſhewing himſelfe greatly abaſhed at this report, did demand of me; how it could be tollerated, that this ſhould be ſpoken openly in the Pulpit, and the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon not puniſhed for it. Whereunto I anſwered: that there wanted not any accuſers, to call him in queſtion for it: but the number of them (that did beare with him and fauoured him for the frankneſſe and libertie of this his ſpeech) was ſo great,<note place="margin">Portugals hold the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians to be worſe then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</note> that thoſe which did accuſe him, could not be heard. Moreouer, it is an ordinary and vſuall thing with the Portugals, to ſay: <hi>That the Caſtilians are worſe then the Infidels themſelues.</hi> But let them ſpeake the worſt of them they can, yet will they beare and endure it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pe great benefite and aduantage by it. The which the ſayd Nobleman ſeeing, in ſort to make doubt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18931:17"/> of, he did thus reply vnto me: Albeit I doe beleeue ſome part of this you ſay, yet there reſteth one thing, which is as a ſcruple in my mind; and that is, in that (as I haue read) the Portugals and the Caſtilians are both of one and the ſame Prouince, and are borne in a manner of one Stock, and iſſued of one Root, and doe ſpeake one and the ſelfe-ſame Language: that is the opinion of <hi>Coneſtagio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coneſtag. lib. 1. fol. 4. pa. 2.</note> of whom we haue before ſpoken. But he ſayth he knoweth not what: for the Portugals are deſcended of the Gaules, the Celtes, and the Braccates, and their Language is almoſt the ſame with the Latine Tongue. But as touching the Caſtillians, we cannot certainely ſay, from whence they are deſcended: Neuertheleſſe, the beſt iudgement and coniecture thereof, that can be made by circumſtances and euident proofes, is, that they are deſcended of the Vandals, of the Iewes, and of the Moores; and their Language is in a manner all one with that of the Moores, and their pronunciation is all one, or much alike. Thereof it commeth, that the Caſtilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being in the countrey of the Saracens, or of the Turkes, they doe ſoone and very eaſily denie the Chriſtian Faith, and doe turne altogether Turke and Infidell. True it is, that the Princes, great Lords, and <hi>Hijos de Algo,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted eyther from the Gothes, or from the ancient Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, which inhabited the mountaines and the countries of Leon, and of Ouiedo, and the Prouince of Galitia, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which is encloſed the ancient Portugall. <hi>Coneſtagio</hi> in the ſame place laſt before recited, ſayth, that theſe two Nations doe hate each other moſt extreamely: and hee ſetteth downe one notable vntruth, to wit,<note place="margin">The vntruth of Coneſtagio</note> That the hatred of the Portugall doth farre exceed that of the Caſtillians; which is altogether falſe, and vntrue. The Portugals doe not hate the Caſtillians, but they abhorre their actions, as moſt wicked, and full of crueltie and tyrannie: The Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians on the contrarie, becauſe they cannot with any reaſon hate the actions of the Portugals, for that they are good and iuſt, they doe therefore ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e their perſons, who haue ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18931:18"/> often ouercome, vanquiſhed, and ill handled them; and ſo much the more, for that their numbers were alwayes (as a man may ſay) infinite, and the Portugals were very few, and in compariſon of them, as nothing. The hatred of the Caſtillians is ſo certaine againſt the Portugals, that it is vſually ſpoken in manner of a prouerbe, That ſince the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of <hi>Alijbarto,</hi> the Caſtillians would neuer ſuffer any to preach vpon the Fryday, in the firſt weeke of Lent; on which day the Church vſeth to ſing that part of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>Loue your enemies:</hi> and therefore they iudge the Portugals to be like themſelues; and they eſteeme them to be of the ſame nature and diſpoſition as they are. Both the one and the others hatred may well be ſeene by that which <hi>Charles</hi> the fift ſaid one day to the Colonell <hi>Ferras,</hi> a Portugall, who in the warres betweene the ſayd Emperour and <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of France, did ſerue on the French partie againſt the Imperialiſts. The warres being ended, and peace concluded betweene thoſe two Princes, the Portugall retyring himſelfe into his countrey, did paſſe by the way of Caſtile, where he went to viſit the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, who knew him very well, and did loue him for his valour; and doing him great honour in his Court, he ſtayed him there for certaine dayes with him: during which time, as hee was one day deuiſing with him very familiarly,<note place="margin">A ſpeech of Charles the 5. to Captaine Ferras, a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall.</note> hee vſed this ſpeech vnto him:<q rend="margQuotes">Captaine <hi>Ferras,</hi> I would gladly know, what ſhould be the cauſe that made you to follow the partie of the French againſt me, ſeeing wee are of one and the ſame Nation? for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit you be a Portugall, and I a Caſtillian, yet are we both Spaniards. The Colonell made him this anſwere: Sir, when the Portugals doe trauaile abroad out of their owne countrey, whether they be rich or poore, their onely end and ſcope is, to get them honour and reputation. For mine owne part, I had the meanes to liue honeſtly in my countrey, like a Gentleman: neuertheleſſe, being reſolued to ſee the world, I began to caſt my account with my ſelfe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18931:18"/> what courſe I were beſt to take. Hauing made my recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I conceiued with my ſelfe, that I ſhould purchaſe me more honour, by bearing Armes againſt the greateſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the World, then in taking of his part to ſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any other: and for this cauſe I tooke Armes againſt your Maieſtie. The Emperour ſmyling, ſayd: I beleeue that this is not the cauſe, but rather the old rancour and hatred which the Portugals beare to the Caſtillians.</q> Portugall anſwered him againe in great choller: <q>Sir,<note place="margin">An excellent anſwere of a Portugall to Charles the 5.</note> I ſweare vnto your Maieſtie, That neyther for good, nor for bad, I trouble not my minde with the Caſtillians, not ſo much as to thinke of them. </q>The Emperour making ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance as though this anſwere did content him, did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him many times and often: but hee iudged of the Portugall as his affection led him, for hee had enough of the bloud of a Caſtillian by his mothers ſide, to make him to hate him: <hi>A little Leauen, &amp;c.</hi> And thus may you ſee the vntruth of <hi>Coneſtagio:</hi> His Hiſtorie is well written, and in a good ſtyle, but moſt falſe, and full of paſſion, for hee both reprehendeth and iniurieth all thoſe of whom hee ſpeaketh; yea, euen King <hi>Philip</hi> himſelfe, in whoſe fauour hee wrote it: and for this cauſe principally it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Portugall. But leauing <hi>Coneſtagio,</hi> now that we haue ſhewed how the Caſtillian Nation is much more maligne and peruerſe then all the other people of Spaine, I will tell you one thing worthy to be noted ere wee proceed, which doth more neerely touch the Portugall Nation than any of the reſt; that is, That all thoſe Nations generally are ſo deſirous of libertie, that they doe ſeeke by all meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to obtayne it, being readie to receiue euen the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils themſelues, if they would be readie to further and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour them in the ſame. And yet, if any ſtrange Nation ſhould paſſe into Spaine to any other end, they would vſe the vttermoſt of their endeuours to ſtop their paſſage, and to hinder their entrance, making little or no reckoning of their liues, and much leſſe of their goods and ſubſtance.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18931:19"/> When I doe ſpeake of cauſing ſtrange Nations to paſſe into Spaine, I muſt tell you thus much, That they ſhall be much more welcome, and finde better entertainment of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Countrey, when they ſhall be mingled many and diuers Nations together, then if one ſhould goe thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: for that this diuerſitie will take from them all conceit and ſuſpition which they might otherwiſe haue, that their comming were to make a conqueſt of their countrey, and not to procure their libertie and freedome; and ſo they would vndoubtedly receiue them ioyfully, and with all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. In like manner, if the Tyrant ſhould commaund them to goe to the warres out of their owne countrey, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it were for their Religion, they would ſerue him more faithfully then did <hi>Auila</hi> and <hi>Simancas</hi> in Caſtile, or <hi>Celorico</hi> &amp; the Caſtle of Coimbre in Portugall. For proofe hereof,<note place="margin">The meaning hereof is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the end of this Treatiſe.</note> you may remember, how in the yeere 1588. the King of Caſtile in his Fleet and Armie by Sea, that came vpon the Coaſt of France, ſent two Regiments of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, each of them conſiſting of eight hundred men, or thereabouts.<note place="margin">The loyaltie of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</note> Theſe forces (notwithſtanding, that in regard of his vſurpation of the countrey, they were enemies to him) yet hauing promiſed to ſerue him faithfully in this voyage, in the fight which they had againſt the Engliſhmen and Flemings, they did make ſuch proofe of their valour, that they did farre excell all the reſt of the Army in prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe and deedes of Armes; and they alone did more for the ſeruice of the King of Caſtile, then all the reſidue of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes: inſomuch, that there was none of them (who had command and gouernment in the Army) that were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with honour by the King Catholike, ſaue only the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall Colonels;<note place="margin">Portugall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels in the Armie of the yeere 1588.</note> namely, <hi>Gaſper de Souſa,</hi> and <hi>Antonie Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera:</hi> The which <hi>Perera</hi> before that time had ſerued and fought moſt valiantly for the defence of the libertie of his Countrey, and for the ſeruice of his true and naturall King, againſt the ſaid King of Caſtile, at ſuch time as hee entred into Portugall with a mightie Army to inuade it.</p>

Vpon this word, the Countie of Eſſex retyred himſelfe to the Sea ſide, and there went to meete him, the Lords <hi>Scipio de Figueyredo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſcoucelles,</hi> late Gouernour of the Terceras, and <hi>Anthony de Brito Pimentell,</hi> and other Gentlemen Portugals of the Kings trayne; who vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the Count the ſpeech of the Captaine, went on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Caſtle, and aſſured the Captaine, that the King <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> their Lord, was come thither. Within a while after the King arriuing there, and calling the Captaine, who knew him by his ſpeech, hee made him this anſwere: Sir, I come to open the gates vnto your Maieſtie. The port being opened, he kneeled downe before the King, and kiſſing his hands,<note place="margin">The yeelding of the Caſtle of Penicha.</note> deliuered him the Keyes of the Caſtle. This is moſt true, that if he would haue held good, the Engliſh armie had not bin able to haue taken that Caſtle, it was ſo well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and prouided of artillerie, and all things neceſſarie: for beſides great ſtore of Iron peeces, there were 85. of Braſſe.</p>
               <p>All theſe examples doe ſhew euidently, how faithfull the Portugals are to them, to whom they haue once promiſed and plighted their faith and fidelitie. And for as much as I know that your Maieſties haue conceiued an opinion of me as of a perſon giuen to be ſomewhat curious, and who is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18931:20"/> acquainted with the accidents which paſſed in this Voyage, and that your Maieſties haue a deſire to vnderſtand what was the cauſe why <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> did not continue in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, and what made him to render vp this Caſtle, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places which were impregnable, and to returne into England with his armie, without doing any other act of any worth, and with the loſſe of the greateſt part of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, with which he was embarked; I will briefely recount the ſucceſſe of this Iourney, crauing many particularities, becauſe to count them all, it would require much more time then is requiſite for the finiſhing of this Treatiſe. I ſay then, that as God, when he chaſteneth &amp; humbleth great Eſtates and Monarchies, doth ſuffer and permit, for the ſinnes of the people, ſuch as are like <hi>Pharao's, Nabuchodonozors, Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's, Nero's,</hi> and <hi>Diocleſians,</hi> vſing them as his executioners and hangmen (as <hi>Attila</hi> called himſelfe the Scourge of God, and <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the Wrath of God:) ſo it ſeemeth he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that K. <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould be his miniſter &amp; the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his wrath &amp; anger; and that in his ſecret iudgement, beyond all apparance of humane reaſon, his will is not yet that Portugall ſhould be deliuered and ſet at libertie: for it is not poſſible, that men ſhould be ſo blinded, to their owne loſſe and deſtruction, as they were in this Voyage, if the Diuine puiſſance had not blinded them, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the vſe of their ſence and vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the Armie was embarked at Douer,<note place="margin">The declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall Voyage in the yeere 1589.</note> the 24. of March, and from thence went to Plimmouth: From thence they departed all together the 29. of Aprill; at which time perceiuing their numbers to be greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, by the contagion that was amongſt them; in ſtead of taking the direct way to Portugall, they ſet their courſe for the Groine, where the moſt part of the ſouldiers died, and all the beſt Canoniers: inſomuch, that their forces were much abated, and they gaue thereby good leyſure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enemie, both to ſend freſh men into Lisbon, and to draw out of Portugal thoſe who were any way ſuſpected:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18931:21"/> as they did indeed take from thence more then an hundred Lords and Gentlemen of marke,<note place="margin">Noble men taken out of Portugall by the Caſtillian.</note> who were all of them very contrarie to him, and by their abſence were greatly miſſed both of their King and countrey. They came to the Groine the ſixt of May, where they were till the twentieth, on which day they did againe take ſhipping, and ſet ſayle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Portugall, where they tooke land at Penicha the ſixe and twentieth. From thence (hauing left in the Caſtle cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſouldiers with <hi>Anthonie de Brito Pimentell,</hi> aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, who is the chiefe of the Houſe of the <hi>Pimentels</hi> of Spaine, and about 800. ſick men) they tooke their way (the Generall <hi>Drake</hi> by Sea, and the Lord Generall <hi>Norris</hi> by Land) with 35. or 40. horſe, and ſome 6000. foot, ſo ill ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that a good part of them wanted their Swords, and there was not of them aboue 50. Corſlets: the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was want of Waggons and Carriages, for to carry them ouer the land; and the ſouldiers themſelues were conſtrained to carry their powder on their ſhoulders. Beſides, many of them at their departure out of their lodgings, had left their Pikes, and ſome their Harquebuſes, loading themſelues with pots &amp; bottels of Wine, which they found there in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,<note place="margin">Wine marreth all.</note> the which in very truth did the more hinder and endomage them: for by meanes hereof they fell into diuerſe diſeaſes, and died in great numbers; the Engliſh Nation not being accuſtomed to drinke Wine alwayes, &amp; their Beere is not ſo ſtrong a kind of drinke. The day following, 3. leagues before their arriuall to a Towne called <hi>Loires Vedras,</hi> the keyes of the Caſtle were brought to the king <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> which Caſtle is ſo ſtrong, that 20. men with neceſſarie mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions may keepe &amp; defend it againſt 100000. All the way along to Lisbon (which is 60. good miles) there was not one Caſtillian that durſt appeare; and 7. horſemen Engliſh did put to flight 60. Caſtillians. From thenceforth many Portugals came to kiſſe the hands of their King, in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance: notwithſtanding, for that they came without armes, hauing beene before diſarmed, and for that there
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18931:21"/> was no body of whom they might get or haue any neither for loue nor money (howbeit that they brought with them good ſtore of ſiluer purpoſely to that effect) they did the moſt part of them returne againe to their owne houſes: and there could not be armed of them aboue one thouſand foot, and 120. horſe with Lances and targets: notwithſtanding that the number of them which came was in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18931:22"/> any part. The other reaſon was, for that being in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on the Eaſt ſide, they ſhould cleare and free the way for the good people of Portugall to come and to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto their king.

Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Portugals which followed the king, hauing diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them to be Caſtilians and not Portugals, did giue the Alarme ſo hotly, that a regiment of Engliſhmen with certaine Portugals making out towards the enemy, did charge him with that fury, that they made them betake themſelues to plaine flight,<note place="margin">The repulſe &amp; flight of the Caſtilians.</note> and ſlue of them vpon the place ſixeſcore: beſides that they tooke fortie or fiftie of their horſes; and the flight of the Caſtilians was ſo haſtie and headlong, that in their entry into the Citie, they left the gate of Saint <hi>Antan</hi> wide open. In this encounter died an Engliſh Cauallier, Colonel of a regiment named <hi>Bret,</hi> a braue man, and had great experience in the art Militarie.

And laſt of all, to them alone doth belong the choyſe and election both of the Heads and Leaders, and of one Generall and chiefe Commander: vnto whom, as to the Soueraigne, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould be ſubiect and obedient. See then the reaſon why the Lord Generall <hi>Drake</hi> (being named and ſent by Merchants who were moſt ingaged in this voyage) did frame himſelf to do that which they would, and what came into his owne braine and fancy, rather then that which the other Lord Generall <hi>Norris</hi> did well and wiſely aduiſe and counſell him, who was a man of ſingular experience, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vnderſtanding, as well in politike gouernment, as in deeds of Armes, and all matters of warfare. For this worthy Lord did ſtriue and labor by all meanes conuenient to haue made a longer abode in Portugall, both in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Lisbon and elſewhere: but after that the army had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18931:24"/> once ſet ſayle, the ſaid Lord General <hi>Norris</hi> could not from thence forward, by any entreaties, perſwade <hi>Drake</hi> to ſet foot on land againe in Portugall, and not ſo much as to take one Citie, where it was wel knowne that there was not any forces, nor any reſiſtance made: neyther was there any meane for the enemie eyther to haue ſuccoured it, or after the taking thereof, to beſiege it for one yeere at the leaſt. Beſides that, with the ſame it is moſt certaine, that they might haue found in Gold, Siluer, Silkes, and Clothes, more then a million of Duckats. Moreouer, the ſaid place might eaſily haue beene fortified, and by that meanes might haue commanded many other places: and afterwards, money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent into France, England, Holland, and other parts, they might haue leuied and led thither aboue fiftie thouſand ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſooner, then the enemie could haue gotten together fiue thouſand. And this I thinke will ſuffice for your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties to vnderſtand that which you deſire in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>But now let vs returne to the purpoſe which wee had in hand. We haue ſaid, that by this one example it may eaſily be perceiued, how faithfull and loyall the Portugall Nation is to them, vnto whom they do once promiſe faith and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie: and therefore God graunt, that they doe not accord nor vnite themſelues to the Caſtilian, and that neyther your Maieſties, nor the other Princes and Potentates of Europe doe not conſent nor permit them to doe it, nor doe giue them occaſion to loſe the hopes which they yet haue of their libertie. And you ought not to attend or ſtay vpon the death of <hi>Philip:</hi> for it may be, that the Portugall will more eaſily accord with the ſonne then with the father. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Monarchie of the Caſtillian is neyther gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nor conſerued with the ſword, but by good and ſage counſaile; ſo albeit he ſhould die, yet the ſame counſaile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth and remaineth ſtill.

               <p>This that wee haue here left recited, doth prooue that which was before ſpoken: and therefore to returne to the matter in hand: I ſay in the fifth and laſt place, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer a great and puiſſant army ſhall be raiſed to paſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spaine, be the charge neuer ſo great, if it do nothing elſe then waſt and ſpoile the countrey, and take ſome few cities and townes, and if in regard thereof the Caſtilian be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to call home his forces (which he holdeth in theſe parte of Europe for his owne defence, though the comming of thoſe his forces ſhould cauſe our army to retire, yet I ſhould hold this for a very great benefit; becauſe that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be done with an hundred, will then be done with ten men, and the charge and expences will bee ſtill leſſe and leſſe. But it may be, that ſome of your Maieſties ſubiects will ſay vnto me, that this is a matter of great difficultie, and at this time eſpecially very hard to be done: for that hauing the enemy here at hand, euen at our backes, there were ſmall reaſon for vs to tranſport our forces into foraine parts. This a good doubt, and may be ſome trouble to men of a ſhallow and ſmall vnderſtanding, and ſuch as haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle iudgement to diſcourſe vpon the ſtate of matters: but to them which know the depth and ground of things, it will carry no apparance of danger. But to the intent the trueth may the better appeare, let vs reaſon together each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of demanding and anſwering, as is vſed in the Schooles.</p>

If after the taking of Laon, and the reducing of ſo many good townes, there had been imployed 200000 crowns, which are demanded for this enterpriſe, it may bee, you ſhould haue had by this time more then three milllions in your purſe, and you ſhould not haue loſt al theſe towns in France of ſo great import; Cambray, Dourlan, Calice, Ardes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miens, and many other places, with your great Admirall: and ſo many braue gentlemen and Captaines which are now dead, would ſtil haue liued to ſpeake in French. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, doe not excuſe your ſelfe and ſay for your diſcharge, that a man cannot diuine what will follow: for you haue beene too too much forewarned of matters as they haue fallen out, and there is yet liuing a Lord, one of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, who at Fountaine Belleau in May 1595. did by all meanes he could poſſibly deuiſe, perſwade the vndertaking of this enterpriſe; alledging ſo many reaſons and ſo euident, that he plainly ſhewed, how greatly it did import France to make a voiage into Portugall: but they would not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor ſo much as giue eare vnto him: <hi>Thy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of thy ſelfe, O Iſraell.</hi> Is not this true? anſwer mee. <hi>Sub.</hi> I confeſſe it; there is nothing more true: and at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, Calice, and Amiens wee haue loſt ſo much, as it is a mockery to ſpeake of three millions, for that the moueables of Calice onely were worth more then a million, and thoſe of Amiens much more.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18931:26"/> without hiding any of our thoughts from you. The cauſe is, for that we are vnwilling to hazard and ſet vp the reſt of our eſtates vpon the ſayings,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> and vpon the opinions of a Nation that is paſſionate and in miſerie: but we hold it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to defend our owne as well as we may, rather then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all to vtter ruine and deſtruction: for to what purpoſe will it be to ſend 12. or 15. thouſand men into Spaine, where there is ſo great a multitude of people? We cannot beleeue that there can come ſo great good of ſuch a iourny, as you in the beginning of your Treatiſe would perſwade vs: and all the world doth both thinke and ſpeake no leſſe; affirming, that it is onely the deſire of thoſe (who are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized and in bondage, and doe long to ſee their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey deliuered from that tyrannicall ſeruitude) which doth make all things to ſeeme and appeare eaſie to bee done. <hi>Pil.</hi> O that it would pleaſe God to open the eyes of your vnderſtandings, that you might know your ſelues, and that you might be able to diſcerne the good from the ill, the ſweet from the ſower, and the blacke from white. It muſt needs bee a great griefe vnto the Phiſitions, when they ſee that their patients are wilfull and obſtinate, becauſe in the curing of them, there is neither reaſon nor counſell which will ſeeme pleaſing or agreeable vnto them. And in very truth, I doe aſſure you, that I hold it in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any man (be he neuer ſo ſage, or quick &amp; cleere ſighted) to perceiue the thouſandth part of the griefe and ſorow which I endure to ſee you (my maſters) euen you of France and England ſo obſtinate, as that you will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceiue, nor ſo much as vnderſtand, that whereupon your whole ſaftetie and deliuerance doth depend: that you are ſo inclined to follow a tracke or by-path, which will throw you downe headlong to a moſt miſerable ruine, out of which there will be no recouerie. But ſeeing I haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo little in ſpeaking to you in particular, and that euery man doth talke of theſe matters in publike, I will now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turne my ſpeech to the whole world.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:18931:27"/>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, that it is very hard and difficult to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution any matter of great waight and importance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out indangering of ſome things of like kinde and nature;<note place="margin">To gaine any thing there muſt be much hazarded.</note> and a man cannot gaine or purchaſe any thing without ſome great hazard and aduenture. If Marchants ſhould not aduenture their goods vpon the Seas, and commit them to the mercy of tempeſts and pyrats, or enemies, they would not make ſuch great gaine and commoditie as we ſee them to do dayly: neither ſhould Kings or Princes haue need of ſo many officers, or of ſo many cuſtomers: and the exceſſiue profit which men make both for themſelues, as well as for their countrey would ſoone ceaſe: neither would they ſo prodigally ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; beſtow their goods &amp; their liues, in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into ſo many dangers for the diſcouering of Lands ſo farre ſcattered and remoued from them. If all this be done for the gaining of 10, 15, or 20, for 100, how much more ought you to doe it to redeeme and deliuer your ſelues from ſo great trouble and calamitie, and from ſo many dangers which doe threaten and menace you? And if you caſt your your account well, you ſhall finde that you gaine more then 100 for one. Thus much concerning the firſt point of your ſpeech. And whereas you ſpake of people paſſionate and in miſery: I cannot forget it, but I muſt and will anſwer you to that point alſo. O how it would reioyce me, if you wold vnderſtand, that this is but the malice of the deuill and his followers, to make men beleeue, that that which is told them (howſoeuer it be founded vpon truth and reaſon, and thoſe aduertiſements which are giuen them for their good and benefit (and which were needfull for them to receiue and imbrace) do proceed onely of paſſion: to the intent he may by meanes hereof hinder and withdraw them from all good actions, and bring them to vtter ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">The condition of the aſſaila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t farre differeth from that of the defendant.</note>

               <p>Secondly, it is moſt certaine, that the condition and eſtate of them which are defendants, is much more miſerable then that of the aſſailants, becauſe for to defend themſelues they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18931:27"/> ſhall need greater ſtore of men and forces, then to aſſaile their enemies. The reaſon: for that thoſe which ſtand vpon their defence, doe not know vpon what ſide the enemy will eſſault them: and they which do aſſaile, do well know where the enemy holdeth his principall force and ſtrength for his defence. For example; ſuppoſe that the enemy put within <hi>Amiens</hi> 100. horſe onely, and foure or 5000, foot: now for you to defend your ſelfe from them, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that you doe place good and ſtrong garriſons in <hi>Abbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uille, Eeu, Diep, Roan, Giſors, Gournay, Pontoiſe, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Senlis, Compeigne, Han, S.

But I haue heard what paſſed in this encounter, of many Gentlemen Spaniards, my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, who were preſent at it, and eſpecially of one that was borne in Valentia, named <hi>Don Gaſper,</hi> who ſaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by Sea, being ſore hurt; and of a Drumme, that was a Caſtillian; and of a Portugall, borne in Villa Vicoſa: the which two onely had their liues ſaued, being found vpon the Sea-ſhore, after the heat of the fight was paſt.

To be briefe, there died all the flower of Caſtile: for that they ſeeing how Portugall was yeelded vnto them ſo eaſily, and hauing heard that the Iles were very rich, and that the Eaſt Indie Fleet was like to fall into their hands, and being allured with the late ſacke of the ſuburbes of Lisbon, which was valued at three Millions; they had embarked themſelues for this ſeruice as cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as if they had beene going to a Wedding. This is a thing well knowne, that foure or fiue young Portugals, from betweene eighteene and twentie yeeres of age, did at Lisbon, with their Swords and Cloakes onely, make no account of a dozen of Caſtillians.

               <p>Within a few dayes after, there came certaine Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to the Duke of Lancaſter, ſent from the King of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile, who in all humilitie did demaund to haue peace; but the Duke would not hearken vnto them.

The accord therefore was made betweene the King and the Duke in this ſort: That <hi>Henry,</hi> the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Iohn,</hi> named Prince of Caſtile, ſhould eſpouſe <hi>Katherine,</hi> the onely daughter of the ſaid Duke, and of <hi>Conſtance</hi> his wife; and that they two ſhould ſucceed in the Realmes of Caſtile and Leon, and other his Seigniories: That the King ſhould endow both the Mother and the Daughter (as he did) giuing to the Mother the Citie of Guadalaiara, Medina del Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po, and Ouiedo; and afterwards, being with her in the ſaid Towne of Medina, he gaue her Hueta alſo: and to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18931:32"/> for her Dowrie, hee gaue the Eſturies, making and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her Princeſſe, and his ſonne Prince of Eſturie. And from that time forward, the eldeſt ſonne of the Caſtillian King hath alwayes borne and had the ſurname of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie, as of Dauphine in France the Dolphin. Beſides it was couenanted, That he ſhould giue vnto the Duke ſixe hundred thouſand Franks of Gold, for his returne into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and fortie thouſand Franks of yeerely rent, during the liues of him and his wife. <hi>Iohn</hi> of Caſtile accepted all theſe conditions, and that very gladly: for albeit he had France, and the Frenchmen alſo on his ſide, and the King of Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon likewiſe (with whoſe ſiſter hee had beene marryed, of whom was borne the ſaid Prince <hi>Don Henry</hi> and <hi>Fernand,</hi> who was afterward king of Arragon,<note place="margin">All Spaine with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors of France againſt Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, which gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</note> againſt all right and equitie, and to the preiudice of the true and lawfull heires:) and had alſo <hi>Charles</hi> the third king of Nauarre to his friend: yet he knew neuertheleſſe that hauing ciuill warres in his owne Realme, and Portugall his enemy: hee ſhould hazard the fortune of all his eſtates and dominions, of ſuch power was the Realme of Portugall againſt all the reſt of Spaine.

And thoſe of the Duke had beene much more to his profit and aduantage in this accord, if the king of Portugall had been willing thereunto: becauſe he hauing the ſword in his owne hand, hee might haue made partition of the countrey at his owne will and pleaſure: he was the iudge, and did what ſeemed good in his owne ſight.<note place="margin">Plutarch in Apothege.</note> Hee that hath the ſword may deuide the lands as he liſteth.

Now ſee the folly, or rather madneſſe of the man; his diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeded of no other matter but of this: for that the King had denied to giue him a penſion onely of halfe a Duckat monethly for his ſonne: for the cuſtome of Portugall is, that all the Gentlemen ſhall take a penſion (which they call <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radia</hi>) of the King, according to the degrees and qualities of their Nobilities, (which they doe properly call <hi>Fuero:</hi>) and they are to bee enrolled in the bookes of the Kings houſe, which they call the Booke of the Kitchin, or the Booke of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculation.

               <p>But to our purpoſe: At this day <hi>Philip</hi> hath more force, more puiſſance, and many more commodities, to hinder the Turke on that ſide of the Eaſt Indies, from making warres in Europe, then all the other kings of Portugall haue had heretofore. Howbeit, as that is not the way to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his ambitious deſires: ſo cannot he abide in any caſe to heare thereof. For, though it were a good deede and well done: yet it will not be any helpe vnto him towards the preſeruation of this his Monarchy of Portugall, which he hath vſurped with ſo many fraudulent deuiſes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes: and which he pretendeth to leaue vnto his heire, be it by right or by wrong: for he knoweth it to be of moſt great and noble puiſſance,<note place="margin">Portugall, the moſt rich and precious pearle of the crowne of Spaine.</note> and hee eſteemeth it as the moſt rich, precious, and important pearle of his crowne: &amp; indeed ſo it is. And therefore I cannot but grieue at ſome that hold themſelues to be wiſe, and of no ſmall iudgement and vnderſtanding; both French and Engliſh, who will not in any caſe be perſwaded, but that Portugall is a very ſmall and barren countrey, and no greater then Normandie. And ſome others (who ſhew their ignorance) affirme it to bee as great as Brie onely: neither will they beleeue nor agree, that Portugall is within Spaine; but that it is a countrey ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated therefom: and they will ſeeme (forſooth) to reaſon and diſcourſe hereupon, breaking their owne braines about it, to the trouble both of themſelues, and thoſe that heare them. Theſe my maaiſters doe conſtraine me to become a Geographer in this diſcourſe; howbeit, that I make no profeſſion of that ſcience: neuertheleſſe, becauſe it maketh to our purpoſe, it will be requiſite, that we make a generall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18931:39"/> deſcription of that countrey, and recount ſome ſpeciall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars thereof, to the intent the greatneſſe, riches, ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and puiſſance thereof, may be the better knowne and diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Portugall is a part of Spaine,<note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall.</note> ſituated vpon the maine Ocean: and it extendeth to the Weſtward from the Eaſt 115. leagues, and from the South to the Northward 25. leagues. On the North ſide thereof is the realme of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia:</hi> towards the Eaſt, it hath the Prouinces of <hi>Taragon, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitania,</hi> and <hi>Boetica:</hi> and to the South, it is bounded with that part of the Ocean Sea, which lieth towards the coaſt of Affrique. It containeth foure principall Prouinces: the firſt <hi>la Transtagana,</hi> which encloſeth the realme of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garba:</hi> the ſecond, <hi>la Cistagana:</hi> the third, betweene <hi>Duero</hi> and <hi>Migno:</hi> and the fourth, <hi>la Tronſmontana.</hi> Theſe foure Prouinces containe part of the Prouince of <hi>Taragon,</hi> the greateſt part of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> and a part of Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica. It hath in length 5. degrees and a halfe from North to South, and beginneth at <hi>Cape S.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18931:40"/> almoſt all Xantogne, and ſome part of Angoleſme, with a part of Perigort. And this we ſhall ſee cleerely by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, if we make the ſaid Figure quadrant in France of 5. degrees and in length, and 40. leagues in bredth: the forme thereof will bee thus: Draw a line from the Angle on the Eaſt ſide of the quadrant and where it hath the North at the head; and it will begin at Crotoy vpon the riuer of Somme (which is in 50. degrees of eleuation) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Lybourne in Perigort (which is 44. degrees and a halfe) paſſing neere by Roan, by Eureux, Dreux, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe, neere by Chaſtellerauld, by Coue, and betweene Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre and Iarnac and Angoleſme, and between Barbeſieux &amp; Coutras, till you come to the ſayd towne of Libourne: All that countrey which is in the Weſt of this figure, is as great as Portugall. And to the intent, that this which I ſay, may be the better perceiued, it ſhall not be amiſſe to deſcribe the reſt of the Figure. The quadrant which hath his head towards the North, and beginneth in the Eaſt at Crotoy, drawing toward the Weſt, endeth in the Sea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 6. leagues off the Sea coaſt of Cherebourg, and ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by Conſtance and by Graundville neere the towne of Dol by the villages of Becherel, Redon, and Arebon, and entring into the Sea betweene Guerrand and Croiſic, euen to 44. degrees and a halfe, to the Eaſt of the ſayd towne of Libourne 10. leagues from the land, which is to the South of Anchiſes: wee ſhall come to haue our Figure perfect. Moreouer, becauſe there may be no doubt in this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, we will anſwer to an obiection which may bee made by thoſe which will not that Portugall ſhould bee greater then Normandie, and that is, ſeeing the line from the weſt ſide of our Figure paſſeth by Cherebourg, Conſtance, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18931:40"/> all this land, and all the countrey which remaineth there, may be put within the Weſt Angles of the Figure, which are voyd, becauſe they end within the Sea. Now this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration being well made and vnderſtood, and being compared with the greatneſſe of Portugall,<note place="margin">Portugall as great as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> we ſhall finde that her circuit is not only as great as all theſe Prouinces of France, which we haue ſpoken of, but euen as great as all that circuit which is comprehended in the Iſle of great Brittaine, which we call England.</p>
               <p>As touching the fertilitie of Portugall, a man may eaſily iudge thereof by that which <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth of it ſpeaking of <hi>Luſitania,</hi>

It was my chance to be one day in his company with a perſonage of great eſtate, who is daily at great charges, and doth ſpend good ſtore of duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats to haue notice and intelligence of that which paſſeth abroad in the World: and hee did aſſure me for a certaine and vndoubted truth, that one of the greateſt fauourites of the King of Caſtile did demand of him this queſtion:<q rend="margQuotes">What

               <p>So that herein may bee ſeene moſt apparantly, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tyranny of the predeceſſors of the king Catholike now raigning: who, after they had for a while ſuppreſſed the right of others, to the intent themſelues might tyranize ouer thoſe Realmes: yet would afterwards ſeeke againe to reuiue, and to retaine that very right, and title which they had before moſt iniuriouſly vſurped. A thing certainly, which may induce vs rather to ſigh and to lament, then to conceiue any pleaſure and delight, to ſee the Princes of the earth, which beare the name and title of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, to bee neuertheleſſe ſo bad Chriſtians, and ſo inſupportable tyrants, as is this <hi>Philip</hi> the King of Caſtile. Which is the cauſe that all the Eccleſiaſticall and regular perſons of Portugall doe hate him ſo extremely, that when the commandement was giuen them, that in certaine of their prayers, and in their Canonicall houres, they ſhould expreſſely pronounce the name <hi>Philip</hi> (for the King knew well, that vnder the name of King vſed indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, they did in their hearts vnderſtand and pray for <hi>Don Anthonio.</hi>) They tooke his commandement in ſo ill part, that they could not bee brought to doe it. But in the end they ſeeing themſelues preſſed by the commandement of the Biſhops and Prelates, they did at length pronounce his name, but with ſuch diſdaine and in dignitie, as I am aſhamed to ſpeake it: notwithſtanding becauſe theſe matters doe well concurre together, and it is not from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18931:49"/> our purpoſe; and beſides, becauſe hee that ſhall rehearſe them, is not to be blamed for the reciting, for that hee is bound to repreſent them onely in manner and forme as they were done, I haue determined to recount vnto you two examples concerning this matter, of the which we doe now intreat.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of Lisbon hauing giuen out and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Kings commandement afore mentioned, through out all the Churches of Lisbon, in the yeere 1582. the firſt of Ianuary: vpon the day of the three Kings next enſuing, a certaine Curate, as he was ſaying a ſolemne Maſſe in his Pariſh Church, with great pompe and ſolemnity, and the Church full of people, when hee came to the end of the prayer which is vſually ſaid after <hi>Gloria in excelſis:</hi> in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words, <hi>Et Famulum tuum regem noſtrum</hi> (that is) thy ſeruant our King; he ſuddenly ſtopped, and turning himſelfe towards the Deacon and Subdeacon, he ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them with loud voyce. Tell me, tell me, how call you this Diuell: And they anſwering him, <hi>Philip,</hi> he named <hi>Philip,</hi> and ſo went on with his Maſſe.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time it happened that a religious perſon of the order of S. <hi>Dominicke,</hi> making mention of the King in a certaine prayer, without naming him by his name of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and being commanded by his Prelate, vnder paine of contempt and diſobedience, that he ſhould name him by his proper name: he then repeated it, ſaying; <hi>Et Famulum tuum regem noſtrum Philippum, Ducem Albenſem, Sanchum de Auila &amp; Rodericum Sapata, caeteróſque omnes diabolos, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay: And thy ſeruant our King <hi>Philip,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Alua, Sancho de Auila,</hi> and <hi>Rodericke Sapata,</hi> and all the other Diuels. When I rehearſed this vnto a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of good account, with whom I communicated the greateſt part of this diſcourſe, hee wondered greatly, vſing this exclamation; Ieſu, doe the Prieſts and Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Portugall thus hate his Catholike Maieſty? This is a ſtrange thing, and I maruell much that they hating him ſo
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18931:50"/> extreamely, and being of ſuch ſtrength and puiſſance in their Countrey, (for the moſt part of them are Noblemen and Gentlemen, and ſome of them great Princes) that they doe not cauſe the people to riſe in armes againſt that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. I anſwered him, the cauſe is, for that albeit they haue neuer ſo iuſt a cauſe to take armes, yet the Portugals are a people of great patience and ſufferance towards their Prince: and they doe alſo goe to the warres with ſo ill a will, (howbeit, that being once in the warres, they proue very good Souldiers) that they had rather goe to hanging. Neuertheleſſe, if they ſhould once riſe againſt the Caſtilian, they would defend themſelues in ſuch manner, that hee ſhould neuer more be able to ſuppreſſe them.</p>
               <p>The whole ſubſtance of the matter is: that they doe once grow to a reſolution, and that they ſet hand to the worke: which if they once doe, I beleeue that they will make as great a wall betweene Portugall and Caſtile, as they of China did in times paſt make betweene them and the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians: and if it were but onely to content the ſoule of their King <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſecond,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Nobleman, to whom I recounted all theſe things, giuing me great thankes, ſaid vnto me: Certainely I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad, and doe thanke you heartily for acquainting me with theſe particulars, which are things worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and ſuch as I haue not at any time heard or ſeene

And let this ſuffice for an aunſwer to the firſt propoſition alledged by you.</p>

               <p>As touching the ſecond: true it is, that <hi>Philip</hi> hath greatly aduaunced the Chriſtian faith in the Weſt Indies: in ſo much that this doeth ſerue him greatly as a cloake or mantle to couer, and to augment his vſurped power and tyrannie: but this good worke ought to bee impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuch deuout and religious perſons, both of his ſubiects and others, as haue bene the inſtruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, rather then to him. See, I pray you, and conſider well, how hee hath extended Religion in Affrique: hee hath euen of late, againſt the inſtitutions of the order of the Knights of the Religion of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and others, concluded and made peace in Barbarie with the Infidels, to the intent hee might with the more commoditie make warre in Europe againſt the Chriſtians. And what doeth hee at this day againſt the Turke, but onely dallie and trifle with him?</p>
               <p>Touching the third of your propoſitions: hiſtories doe well recount, and all men may aſſure themſelues, how much hee loueth the Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence hee beareth to them that are religious. In times paſt, it was neuer ſeene, that any Eccleſiaſticall or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſon hath beene put to death in Spaine, for any matters concerning the eſtate. The greateſt crueltie, and moſt rigorous ſeuere iuſtice, that the Arrian Princes ſhewed vppon them for being contrarie to their opinions, was to impriſon them, and to keepe them encloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Monaſteries. True it is, that of ſome of them they did put out the eyes, and afterwards, ſome Princes did cauſe them to be put to death ſecretly in priſon: but as for the gallowes, and ſuch like infamous deaths, they knew not what it meant, ſaue onely ſince the reigne of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, that will be held for ſo great and ſo good a Catholike. And I for my part do beleeue, that he is no leſſe: and yet I know he is but a very bad Chriſtian: for I make no doubt but he beleeueth all that which the holy Catholike, Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Romane Church our mother teacheth, and inſtructeth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18931:57"/> vs: howbeit I know full well, that he doth not obſerue any of the precepts commanded in the Decalogue.</p>
               <p>And as concerning the reſt of your allegations made in his excuſe; although that <hi>Philip</hi> hath builded vp a great number of Monaſteries, and many Churches, endowing them with rich reuenues, yet all this will not make me, but that I muſt needes take him and acknowledge him for a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tyrant, and a moſt cruell Prince. Hiſtoriographers haue written largely of the cruelty of <hi>Brunhault,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brunhault cauſed ten kings of France to be put to death.</note> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, that ſome would excuſe her, and doe attribute this fault vnto the firſt Writers) and they doe affirme, that ſhee cauſed to be put to death ten ſeuerall Kings in France, and many other perſons of great quality. Alſo they write of her, that ſhee cauſed a great number of Churches to be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and did prouide them of ſo great goods and riches, that it is a very ſtrange thing to be reported. See what <hi>Gaguin</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gaguin.</note> writeth thereof: in ſo much, that if a man would compare the charge and expences of <hi>Brunhault,</hi> with the meanes ſhee had, he would greatly maruell, how this woman was able in one age to build ſo many Temples, and aſſigne vnto them alſo ſo good and large reuenues. Now <hi>Brunhault</hi> hath deſerued another manner of praiſe and commendation, for vſing ſo great liberality towards the Church, then doth <hi>Philip,</hi> becauſe ſhee gaue of her owne, and <hi>Philip</hi> giueth of other mens. In Spaine they finde great fault with thoſe that will ſteale a ſheepe, and will giue the feete for Gods ſake: and ſo doth his Catholike Maieſty; hee draweth from the Clergy <hi>Tercias, Subſidio, Pila, Eſcuſado:</hi> in ſo much,<note place="margin">See the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe words a little after.</note> that of ten he taketh at the leaſt fiue: and one Prelate payeth more vnto him then 2000 labourers, or 4000 Gentlemen. See then how liberall he is to the Clergy: and by the meanes of theſe feete of his ſheepe, hee buildeth vp Monaſteries and other Churches, and endoweth them with great reuenues. Moreouer, who is he that hath medled with ſetting to ſale the Townes and Caſtles which were of the iuriſdiction and vaſſals of the Church? It is your great friend <hi>Philip,</hi>

The King <hi>Don Henry</hi> brother germane to the mother of Saint <hi>Lewes,</hi> being but a ladde, was ſlaine by the hazard of a brick or tile falling vpon him within Placentia. Some doe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this his death to the careleſneſſe of the ſaid <hi>Henry,</hi> for not prouiding a remedy (albeit hee were in his tender and younger yeeres,) againſt the extortions done vpon the Churches, by the children of the Count <hi>Don Nugno de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who were Tutors to the ſaid <hi>Henry,</hi> and Gouernours of his Realme: and they doe affirme, that all thoſe diſaſters and miſhaps which Hiſtories doe write of, did happen by the occaſion of thoſe his Tutors. Theſe examples may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to proue vnto you the abuſe and inualidity of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and to ſhew that your <hi>Philip</hi> by laying of his hands vpon the Eccleſiaſticall liuings, (as he hath done) cannot excuſe himſelfe of fraud, ſacriledge, and tyranny; and ſo by this meanes (with an ill conſcience) hee ſtealeth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18931:59"/> the ſheepe of another man, notwithſtanding that hee giue againe the feete for God ſake. And yet ouer and aboue all this, I doe aſſure you euen in the faith of an honeſt man, that if there were no other vices the perſon of King <hi>Philip</hi> ſaue onely theſe two, to wit, tyranny and cruelty, and if hee were a true obſeruer of the reſt of the Law and faith Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, I would excuſe you of your blindneſſe and inueigle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but you may hold this for a certainty, that his abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable workes will proue any man whomſoeuer to be an egregious lyer, that ſhall be ſo hardy as to defend that hee is no ſuch manner of man.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18931:59"/> taken, and the Lord <hi>de Iuoy</hi> was put to death betweene two Tables, with many other Lords and Gentlemen. He had the better meanes and opportunity to treat with the ſaid Churches, by reaſon there were many Catholikes mingled amongſt the Huguenots: all of which did gouerne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themſelues according to the conuentions and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made betweene them: and a great Lord of France, and the Lord <hi>Mounſieur de Chaſtillion,</hi> howbeit that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards this vnion was broken. Some of their chiefe heads did giue eare vnto thoſe perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Philip,</hi> inſomuch that there were great preparations made for a ſtrong &amp; mighty warre againſt them, which ſucceeded not long after, when Brouage was taken. Beſides, the ſaid Lords and heads of the reformed Religion, with ſome of their Miniſters, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a great iealouſie of the moſt Chriſtian King now raigning, (who was then King of Nauarre) and of the late <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince of Condy, they reſolued ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Towne of Montauban, to call in ſtrangers of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be their Protectours and defenders. And to that effect, they ſent one of their Miniſters into Almaine, feining that they ſent him vnto the pretended reformed Church of Metz. Notwithſtanding the matter was diſcouered by one of the principall Lords, newly drawne to be of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who had taken great indignation againſt a Miniſter of his owne, and becauſe hee had been an aſſiſtant at the ſame Councell, he thought he had beene of the ſame minde alſo: and did therefore reproue him, ſaying: that he greatly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled how he could ſuffer ſuch a quill to be thruſt through his noſe, without laughing at it. But the Miniſter excuſed himſelfe, aſſuring him that he knew nothing of that matter. But that was an occaſion, that the practiſe brake off: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that they were not well agreed amongſt themſelues, whom they ſhould chooſe to bee their chiefe and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour: ſome of them deſired the Duke <hi>Caſimier:</hi> others would haue England: and ſome others the Duke of Sauoy: who all that time did not know any thing at all of that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18931:60"/> which paſſed betweene him and the Miniſters. But after that, at ſuch time as the young Duke (now preſently ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) came to ſucceed his Father, he being aduertiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſent vnto the King of Nauarre, to demaund the Lady his ſiſter for his wife: one named <hi>Seruin</hi> was diſpatched as the meſſenger to that effect, and after him a Viſcount; who ſeeing great difficulty in the demaund, went by Bearne into Spaine, where he treated the mariage of the Infant <hi>D. Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> at this day Dutcheſſe of Sauoy: which mariage <hi>Don Amadis</hi> the baſtard brother of the ſaid Duke after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards effected. This mariage came well to purpoſe for <hi>Philip,</hi> becauſe by this meanes hee aſſured himſelfe of the Duke, that he ſhould attempt nothing in Portugall: where he knew full well, that after the death of King <hi>Henry,</hi> there was great diuiſion amongſt the Portugals, for that ſome would haue had the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> Dutcheſſe of Bragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia: others the Lord <hi>Don Anthonio:</hi> and in a manner all well neere not liking to haue any of thoſe which were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, would haue had the ſaid Duke of Sauoy, being the Graund-childe of a Daughter of Portugall, who (as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is) if hee had gone thither during the inter-raigne in Portugall, at the time of that diſſention, and by reaſon of their vnwillingneſſe to admit the one or the other of thoſe aboue named, he had without doubt beene receiued of all the Portugals.</p>
               <p>To proceede, and to ſhew you yet more plainely what manner of man this is, for whoſe loue you doe euen ſeeke your owne deſtruction, and in whoſe ſeruice you are ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſo diligent: I will adde here ſomewhat more tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter, for it is not poſſible to vtter all that may be ſpoken to that effect. It is not long ſince, that for to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteppes of ſome other good and godly Catholikes as himſelfe is, he rendered the City of Arzile to <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> King of Marocco, againſt the will and liking of the Portugals which did inhabit it, who had bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues without his aide to defend it. It was ſuppoſed by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18931:60"/> all the Chriſtians, that <hi>Philip</hi> ſurrendered the City, becauſe hee was aſſured that hee ſhould not be able to defend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the puiſſance of Infidels, for ſo did he himſelfe cauſe it to be giuen out, ſaying:<note place="margin">The reaſon why Philip rendred that City of Arzil to Muley Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note> That it was a leſſe miſchiefe to render it without hazarding the liues and goods of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, then by keeping it, to put them all in daunger. But therein hee abuſed them moſt maliciouſly, for the true cauſe why this good Catholike rendered this City of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians vnto the Moores, was becauſe he had promiſed it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their King, vpon condition he ſhould not lend two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crownes to <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> his couſin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, King of Portugall. The which ſumme the Moore had before promiſed to lend him at the interceſſion of England: and for this reaſon had the ſaid <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> ſent his ſonne <hi>Don Chriſtopher</hi> to Marocco to be there in hoſtage for the ſaid ſumme of money, who remained there by the ſpace of foure yeeres. You ſee now what a good and Catholike Chriſtian deede this man did, whom you doe ſo defend for a moſt ſingular Chriſtian and Catholike, who to hinder a King, a farre better Catholike then himſelfe, from recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his owne, doth not onely tyrannically detaine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right, but doth make it away from Chriſtians, to giue it vnto Infidels. What anſwer doe you make hereunto? I make your ſelues the Iudges: wherefore then will you not acknowledge the irreligion of this man, to whom you are ſo affectionate, and the great malice and peruerſeneſſe of him, whom you loue ſo well? Conſider and know, that you are taken and bound with a groſſe chaine:<note place="margin">Pſalme 41.</note> and that <hi>abiſſus abiſſum inuocat:</hi> One depth calleth another. And I ſay to you, one fault draweth on an hundred thouſand after it. Of the maintaining and defending of an euill and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, enſueth commonly a ſiniſter and peruerſe iudgement of them which are good. This was well ſeene to be true and verified in the life time of <hi>Don Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> and is yet ſtill euen at this day. It is a ſhame to heare the abhominations which the fauourers of this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18931:61"/> pretended King Catholike haue heretofore ſpoken and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out, and doe not yet ceaſe to ſpeake of this poore Prince deceaſed. Some call him rebell, others terme him a runni-gate, and a fugitiue from place to place, and from Countrey to Countrey: and ſome others call him a ſeditious perſon, an enemy to Chriſtendome, an Infidell, and an hereticke. Can there be any thing more grieuous, more ſenſible, more vniuſt, and more vnworthy of a Chriſtian? How dare you (againſt all Lawes both diuine and humane) handle and vſe ſo ill, a Prince, the ſonne of the greateſt Prince of his age: the graund-child of that great <hi>Emanuel,</hi> from whom the Princes of Europe doe glory to draw their deſcent and originall: a Prince ſore preſſed and turmoyled with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, trouble and perplexity. He hath well ſhewed euen in his exile and baniſhment, that he was a better Catholike then your <hi>Philip</hi> his couſin: leſſe ambitious, without chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, without hatred, and full of charity. For if he would haue beene content to recouer his Realme of Portugall, with more honourable meanes then your tyrant hath tyrannized ouer it, and doth yet tyrannouſly detaine it, hee might well haue done it. If he would haue accorded, that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſhould haue had exerciſe of their Religion in Portugall, onely within their owne Houſes and lodgings, the Earle of Leiceſter (whom ſome call the Count of Leſt) would haue vndertaken to ſet him againe in poſſeſſion of his Realmes and Seigniories. In the yeere one thouſand fiue hundred eighty nine, when hee paſſed into Portugall with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, amongſt other Articles of agreement made betweene them, there was no other thing granted nor yeelded vnto them, but onely a licence or liberty for them to liue in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, without being bound or compelled by the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Prelates, to repaire to the Churches to the ſeruice and exerciſe of the Catholikes. And in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the Queene of England did then entertaine the ſtraungers Catholickes, inhabiting within her Realme of England: euen ſo did hee accord and ordaine that the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18931:61"/> Engliſh ſhould finde the like vſage and entertainement in Portugall. And it may be, that if he would haue enlarged their libertie in this reſpect, the Engliſh would againe haue enforced their aboade in that Countrey. But he proceeded ſo like a Catholicke with them, that they had a kinde of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, and tooke occaſion to ſuſpect him. The king of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco at this day now raigning, (of whom wee haue lately ſpoken) ſent an Embaſſadour into England, to intreat him, touching the deliuering of Portugall from her tyranny: of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to make preſent payment of 100 thouſand Crownes at London, for the prouyding of 100 ſayle of ſhipps to paſſe into Barbary, from whence he promiſed to embarke, and to paſſe with him in perſon, and alſo to ſet at liberty about ſeuen or eight thouſand Portugalls, whom he held in captiuity, and which were good ſouldiers, and with them and the principall horſe of Barbary, to take land and ſet foote in Spaine, and to put him in poſſeſſion of his Realme. But <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> would not accept thoſe his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, becauſe hee would giue no occaſion to the Moores, (namely thoſe Moores that are baptized and liue as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in Arragon, Valentia, Murcia,<note place="margin">The cauſe why Don Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio refuſed the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his Realme.</note> and other quarters of Spaine, where the Moore did aſſure himſelfe to finde 60 thouſand men at his deuotion) there to rebell, and to worke the miſery and calamity of the Chriſtians. This was a more daungerous matter, and would haue beene more burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and chargeable to King <hi>Pbilip,</hi> then to the King <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> with whome <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> deſired to haue made a peace very beneficiall and aduantageous to the Realmes of Portugall: but <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> refuſed all, onely mooued thereunto of a godly Catholicke zeale. Now ſhew me (my Maſters) where or when your <hi>Don Philip</hi> euer did as much: He hath made great promiſes to <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he might cauſe him to renounce his right, which he had in Portugall, by reaſon of his election. He offered to make him Viceroy of Naples,<note place="margin">Offers of king Philip to Don Anthonio.</note> with 400 thouſand Crownes of yearely rent, and the collation of the officers and benefices
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18931:62"/> of that kingdome. Moreruer he would haue giuen him 500 thouſand Crownes to pay his debts, and to defray the charge of going to take that Gouernement vpon him: And that hee would bee bound to reſtore all thoſe Portugals to their former eſtates, whoſe goods he had taken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated for following of his partie. And that hee would aduaunce and recompence ſuch as did ſerue and attend him actually: and that he would pardon all in generall. Whereunto <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> made him this aunſwer: God defend that he ſhould commit ſo great a fault:<note place="margin">Don Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio full of conſcience.</note> and that he had rather die in an hoſpitall, then to doe a thing ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, wicked, vniuſt, and againſt his conſcience, for that the lawes had taught him thus much, that he might not contract for that which appertained to another. For, when he was choſen at Sautaren, he had then ſworne, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards againe at Lisbon (when he was confirmed King by the deputies of the cities and townes of Portugall, which came thither to take their oath for their allegeance, and to doe him homage) that he ſhould neuer accord nor fall to any agreement with the enemy, without leauing Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall in her full and perfect libertie. This may ſerue to ſhew how much better a Catholike, and how leſſe ambitious the King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was then King <hi>Philip.</hi> And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his choller and his hatred or charitie, that may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by this which followeth, in that there haue beene many men who haue oftentimes offered to <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> to kill <hi>Philip:</hi> neuertheleſſe he would neuer giue them any entertainment,<note place="margin">Moſt chriſtian ſpeaches of D. Anthonio.</note> alledging that Kings are the annoynted of the Lord: and although (quoth he) my couſin King <hi>Philip</hi> blinded by ambition and tyrannie, do perſecute me, and do ſeeke to take my life from me, yet will not I be content nor conſent for all that, that any man for the loue of me, ſhould attempt to take his life. And whoſoeuer ſhall dare or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to do it, let him looke to himſelfe that he come not into my hands. For though his ſins do ſo blind and bewitch him, as that they make him ſhew himſelfe a <hi>Saul</hi> againſt me
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18931:62"/> yet I for my part do proteſt before God, to ſhew my ſelfe a <hi>Dauid</hi> towards him. A certaine man on a day demaunding of him a fauour for the good newes which hee brought him (for he had aſſured him that King <hi>Philip</hi> was dead) he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him halfe in choller; My good friend, doeſt thou not know who it is of whom thou ſpeakeſt vnto me? hee is my couſin germane, bring me newes that I haue eight or ten thouſand faithfull men, and well armed with good and ſage Captaines, and all things neceſſary to reſtore Portugall to libertie, and I promiſe thee in the word of an honeſt man, to make thee ſo rich and ſo honourable in my Realme, as no Gentleman ſhall go beyond thee: go, go, learne to know the diſpoſition of Princes Now my maſters, what thinke you of theſe examples? do you now ſee what reaſon I haue to ſay, that the King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was more Catholike, and leſſe ambitious then the king <hi>Philip,</hi> &amp; that he was a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out choller &amp; hatred, but contrarywiſe full of charity? I pray you therefore for the loue of God, that from henceforth you would reſolue your ſelues, with a ſound and vncorrupted iudgement, &amp; a pure conſcience, and without any inueigle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or indiſcreet zeale, to embrace the good, and to reiect the euill. If he be diſhoneſt, luxurious &amp; licentious, I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that behalfe: for that is not the butt or ende of our treatiſe: and I beleeue, that the Prince of Orange in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, hath ſaid ſomething touching that matter: and the infamous rumour and deteſtable report which hath runne, and doth yet runne throughout the world, doeth ſay much to that effect. God giue him the grace to know himſelfe, and to conuert, and to render to euery man his owne before his death, better then he hath reſtored that which (as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) his father at the hower of his death commaunded him to render and to reſtore againe.</p>
               <p>Now, moſt humbly I beſeech your Maieſties to hold me excuſed, for hauing beene ſo large in this matter: becauſe I haue not done it without good cauſe, knowing that to come to the butte and end of my purpoſe, it was very needfull,

I had of late certaine intelligence by letters from ſome of my friends, that the King of Tartaria now raigning (whome the auncient Hiſtoriographers and Coſmographers do call,</hi> Magnum Can, Regem regum, &amp; Dominum dominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, <hi>that is, The great Cham, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords) who is ſaid to be a moſt prudent, braue, ard warlike Prince, hath determined for the great deuotion which he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to his great Prophet</hi> Mahomet <hi>(whoſe ſect he profeſſeth) to paſſe with great forces to Mecha in Arabia, and there to ſeaze vpon the bodie of his ſaid Prophet.

I would to God your Maieſties would now conſider, that if theſe conſiderations do fall into the vnderſtanding of a Barbarian, how much more ought they not to bee wanting in men of iudgemeot and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: and I would your Maieſties would ponder aduiſedly, how much it importeth you not to ſuffer the greatneſſe of the Caſtillian your next and neareſt neighbour.

On the contrarie, in ſteed of mortall enemies which he hath now of them, ſhall finde them to be his friends to ayde and aſſist him, to the maintainance of his ambition and tyrannie. And this is that which hee doth ſeeke and deſire (ſhewing himſelfe in the meane while like a most wylie Foxe) and to this effect he will not ſpare to giue money liberally, becauſe of the good that may redound thereof vnto him. This is a thing most certaine, that hee deſireth extreamly to ſee them made poore and ruinated whom he feareth, &amp;c.

I am ſore afraide, that before many daies be paſt, you will confeſſe you wept hitherto but for trifles, in compariſon of that which is to come.

Notwithſtanding, becauſe I know and am acquainted with all that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne for theſe 50 yeeres laſt paſt in the greateſt part of Europe; I doe therefore tell you, as one that hath had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of theſe matters, that as yet you may recouer (if you will) all that which hitherto you haue loſt, and both deliuer your friends and bridle your enemies. And you may take ſuch order, that the time to come ſhall be more happy and fortunate vnto you, then the time already paſt hath beene. And moreouer, I doe aſſure you, that ſithens the loſſe of great part of Chriſtendome wonne by the Turke, the late loſſe of the moſt part of Germany, the hereditary poſſeſſion of the King of Bohemia, all Switzerland, with the great hazard of loſing all the Netherlands, who are now ſtriuing for breath againſt the King of Spaines mighty powers now in the field, (which I for my part doe thinke to haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the very hand of God, as of your louing Father, who by a fatherly loue doth chaſtiſe you, to the end you ſhould awaken you out of your ſecurity and negligence) I haue beene euer ſince reſolued to ſet downe in writing, that which I haue ſo often pronounced by word of mouth, to ſo many perſons of ſpeciall marke and quality, before that euer they did entreat me thereunto. And this is the cauſe, that if this my writing doe not produce that publike good, and that effect which I deſire, I proteſt that from henceforth I will for euer hold my peace and be ſilent. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, I moſt humbly beſeech your Chriſtian Maieſties and all the Princes and Potentates of Europe, and all the great Lords and Officers of the Crownes of England and of Fraunce, that it would pleaſe you to deſcend into your ſelues, and at your leiſure according to your accuſtomed prudence and wiſdome, to conſider that good fortune and felicity doth not conſiſt ſo much in the conqueſt and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great Seigniories and large dominions, for the time preſent, with an intent to leaue the ſame to your ſucceſſors: but rather to aſſure, confirme, and preſerue them for the time

If the Portugals likewiſe would determine and reſolue themſelues to chooſe by election (as they haue right ſo to doe) ſome Prince or ſome other of the people ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white, or negro (for it is moſt certaine, that to deliuer themſelues of the tyranny of <hi>Philip,</hi> they would be content to receiue to their King the meaneſt negro of Guinee, if he be a Chriſtian, and will liue in the Realme with them) they are fully perſwaded, and they haue reaſon, that this would be a great help and furtherance to the accompliſhment of their deſires, to finde for their defence and preſeruation, a Conſtable of Portugall, a Marſhall, and Admirall, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like officers of the Realme: and their records and writings done in their owne tongue, the faſhions of their garments, and the ſurnames of their families.

And bethinking with himſelfe how he might aſſure and ſecure theſe domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Seigniories vnto himſelfe, he determined not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to roote out and extinguiſh the name and memory of the Brittaines the ancient inhabitants of that Ile, but alſo gaine the good willes and affections of his ſubiects, by a new name, and ſo by that meanes to draw vnto himſelfe the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due which remained yet vnconquered. To this effect and purpoſe he ordained and appointed, and by a perpetuall
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18931:72"/> edict commaunded, that from that day forwards all thoſe ſeuen Realmes ſhould bee named by one onely name England: and that all the inhabitants ſhould name them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Engliſhmen.<note place="margin">Egbert the firſt king of England.</note> And by this meanes hee came readily and fully to the ende of his deſire.

With the like ambition and deſire, <hi>Philip</hi> his great graund-child, pretendeth that the Realmes of Spaine, and now of late Portugall haue conſtantly reſolutely denied him, and which you doe giue him ſo readily and ſo liberally.

               <note place="margin">Cities: the meaning thereof.</note>Cities in Spaine, are thoſe peoples wherein Biſhops Seas are eſtabliſhed. Theſe bee alſo ſome cities which by particular priuiledge (albeit they bee not Metropolitanes nor heads of Biſhoprickes) doe vſe this title and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: howbeit there bee very few of them. Betweene a Citie and a Towne, there is a great difference, aſwell in authoritie, as in prerogatiues, honours and priuiledges. In Cities there are commonly <hi>Corrigidores,</hi> ſpecially in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, who may be reſembled to the Pretours and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the auncient Romanes, which gouerned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces. One citie hath many townes, peoples, and villages, which are ſubiects vnto it, aſwell in temporall as ſpirituall matters. In ſuch ſort, that the cities are as the heads, and the townes as the members. For this cauſe when there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any great affaires or common reuolt in Spaine, the townes do alwayes follow the party of that city whereunto they are dependant, And to reduce any people into a citie,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18931:73"/> the antiquitie of the place is more required then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it. There be many Cities which are but meanely peopled, and Townes which are full and thicke of people. <hi>Valladolid, Medina del Campo, Madril,</hi> and <hi>Caceles</hi> in Caſtile, <hi>Santaren, Abrantes, Setuuall,</hi> and <hi>Oliuenea</hi> in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, are very great Townes, and notably well peopled, and yet they ſurpaſſe in greatneſſe many of the Cities: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, they are not for all that endowed with all theſe prerogatiues, neither are they called Cities. <hi>Valladolid</hi> and <hi>Santaren</hi> are ſo full of people, that when in Spaine we make compariſon of the greatneſſe of Cities and of Townes, we ſay; <hi>Ciudad par ciudad, Lisbona en Portugal: Villa par villa, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alladolid en Caſtilla: ſi quieres otra tal, buſca Sentaren en Portugal,</hi> that is to ſay: City for City, Lisbon in Portugall: Towne for Towne: Valladolid in Caſtile: if you will find any other the like, ſeeke Santaren in Portugall.
